## Overview
book-app is our first Full-stack web application, that uses Google's book API, to search for books by either Title or Author, REST is used to work with the API's information with a future hope of using DataBase to get faster results and make a seamless experience especially with our Front-end work, that uses the Mobile-First Methodology.

## Getting Started
the user will be greeted with a simple form on the home page, the user enters the book name or the Author(s) names, then chooses his preferred way of filtering the results, which will be displayed immediately after clicking the submit button.
